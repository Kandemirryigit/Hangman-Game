Final project looks like this.When I was child I was playing this game with my friends.Of course we were playing with paper and pencil.In my opinion the game is really perfect.

The main idea of the game is: Firstly I gived you 12 words and you can see that words for 3 seconds.After that I gived you hints about the word.If you think you know the word you can directly guess the word or if you don't have an idea about the word you can guess a letter and you can see the word has that letter or not.You have 6 lives if you guees a wrong word or a wrong letter you are going to lose a life.If your lives=0 the game is over.and the man is going to be dead so you lose if your lives =0.
